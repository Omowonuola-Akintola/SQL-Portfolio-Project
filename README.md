# SQL-Portfolio-Project
This will house the projects I work on as I learn SQL. Kindly check my notion page https://www.notion.so/SQL-PROJECTS-c9712b90ebcc4a8db0b000d475bcbbad to see the code and the resulting output 

THE first project is part of Danny Ma's Serious SQL course. To check out the course, use this https://www.datawithdanny.com/courses/serious-sql. I highly recommend the course as Danny covered a lot of essential topics with useful examples.
