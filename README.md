# SQL-Portfolio-Project
This will house the projects I work on as I learn SQL

THE first project is part of Danny Ma's Serious SQL course. To check out the course, use this https://www.datawithdanny.com/courses/serious-sql. I highly recommend the course as Danny covered a lot of essential topics with useful examples.
