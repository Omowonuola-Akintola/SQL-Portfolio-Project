###### For this challenge, the assumption is that I just received an urgent request from the General Manager of Analytics at Health Co for assistance with the 
analysis of the health.user_logs dataset. The Business questions to be answered are listed below and the SQL code I wrote to answer these questions. 

I think this challenge is suitable for those who are just getting started with SQL.

Before I jump into the questions and my solution, I thought it'd be sufficient to show a bit of what the data looks like

#1. 
SELECT * FROM health.user_logs
LIMIT 10;
